Img2ST-Net: Efficient High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction from Histology via a Fully Convolutional Image-to-Image Approach

![Figure1_demo](./fig/Figure1_demo.png)

**Modeling paradigm for spatial transcriptomics predictionï¼š** (A) Conventional patch-to-spot regression manner for Visium ST data: each WSI contains hundreds of 55um spots for the ST slide. A separate gene expression vector is predicted for each spot from its corresponding image patch. (B) Our proposed image-to-image prediction framework for Visium HD data: each WSI contains millions of 8um  bins for the HD slide. A region-wise modeling strategy where each image region covers multiple bins is used to predict a high-resolution gene expression map, which enables more fine-grained and computationally efficient inference.

## Overall Framework

**Overall framework of our proposed Img2ST-Net:** Fig 2: Overall framework of our proposed Img2ST-Net. Region-level histological patches are processed through a UNet-based architecture to predict high-resolution gene expression maps. Simultaneously, regional gene expression profiles are encoded into embeddings using a frozen expression encoder. A contrastive loss aligns these embeddings with intermediate image features, facilitating accurate and efficient spatial gene expression prediction.
